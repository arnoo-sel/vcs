# Fork notes

This fork of leikareipa's VCS aim to maintain a 64-bit Windows version, and provide executables for it.

**Note**: release v2.6.1 and v2.7.0 have been reported not to be compatible with the VisionRGB-PRO series of PCI (non-express) cards.
I'm looking into ways to restore compatibility for later releases. See issue #7.

Below is the original README:

# VCS

A well-featured control application for Datapath's VisionRGB capture cards, with a feature-set targeted especially at retro enthusiasts.

## Features

- Various feature and usability improvements over Datapath's default capture application to maximize capture quality
- Unlimited video presets with programmable activation
- Several scaling modes and image filters
- Variable refresh rate output to match the input
- Works with modern and legacy VisionRGB hardware
- Runs on Windows and Linux
- Free and open source

## Supported capture hardware

VCS is compatible with at least the following Datapath capture cards:

- VisionRGB-PRO1
- VisionRGB-PRO2
- VisionRGB-E1
- VisionRGB-E2
- VisionRGB-E1S
- VisionRGB-E2S
- VisionRGB-X2

## Building

Open [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) in Qt Creator, or run `$ qmake && make -j` in the repo's root. You'll need to meet the [dependencies](#dependencies), and may need to modify some of the `INCLUDEPATH` entries in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) to match your system.

### Dependencies

The VCS codebase depends on the following libraries and frameworks:

1. Qt 5
2. OpenCV 3.2.0*
3. The Datapath capture API, as distributed with their Linux capture drivers**
4. Non-release builds*** are configured to use AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, which should come pre-installed with your compiler on common platforms. For these builds, you'll need to create a file called **asan-suppress.txt** in the directory of the VCS executable, and either leave it blank, or populate it according to [this guide](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#suppressions) to have AddressSanitizer ignore leaks in external code (e.g. third-party libraries).

\* Later versions of OpenCV may also work. See [this issue](https://github.com/leikareipa/vcs/issues/30) for details.\
\** Only needed if compiling for Datapath hardware, which is the default option. See [The capture backend](#the-capture-backend) for details.\
\*** See [Release build vs. debug build](#release-build-vs-debug-build).

I use the following toolchains when developing VCS:

| OS                 | Compiler           | Qt   | OpenCV | Capture card           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Ubuntu 20.04 HWE   | GCC 9.4 (64-bit)   | 5.12 | 3.2.0  | Datapath VisionRGB-E1S |

### Release build vs. debug build

The default configuration in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) produces a debug build, which has &ndash; among other things &ndash; more copious run-time bounds-checking of memory accesses. The run-time debugging features are expected to reduce performance to some extent, but can help reveal programming errors.

Defining `VCS_RELEASE_BUILD` globally will produce a release build, with fewer debugging checks in performance-critical sections of the program. Simply uncomment `DEFINES += VCS_RELEASE_BUILD` at the top of [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) and do a full rebuild.

To confirm whether the program is running in release or debug mode, check the About dialog (right-click VCS's output window and select "About VCS&hellip;"). For debug builds, the program's version will be reported as "VCS x.x.x (non-release build)", whereas for release builds it'll be "VCS x.x.x".

### The capture backend

A capture backend in VCS is an implementation providing support for a particular capture device. For example, Datapath's VisionRGB capture cards are supported in VCS on Windows by the [RGBEasy capture backend](./src/capture/rgbeasy/), which uses the Datapath RGBEasy API.

One (and only one) capture backend must be active in any build of VCS. To select which one it is, set its identifier in the `DEFINES` variable in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro). By default, VCS uses Datapath's RGBEasy (CAPTURE_BACKEND_RGBEASY) on Windows and Vision (CAPTURE_BACKEND_VISION_V4L) on Linux, supporting the VisionRGB range of capture cards on those platforms.

The following capture backends are available:

| Identifier                  | Explanation |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_RGBEASY     | Supports the Datapath VisionRGB range of capture cards on Windows; requires the Datapath VisionRGB driver to be installed. If used when building on Linux, will provide a debug implementation that announces in the terminal which RGBEasy API functions would be called if you were to run the program on Windows. |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VISION_V4L  | Supports the Datapath VisionRGB range of capture cards on Linux; requires the Datapath Vision driver to be installed. |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VIRTUAL     | Provides a device-independent capture source that generates a test image. Useful for debugging, and doesn't require capture drivers to be installed. |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_DOSBOX_MMAP | Allows capturing DOSBox's frame buffer on Linux. Intended for debugging. See [this blog post](https://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/blog/capturing-dosboxs-frame-buffer-via-shared-memory/) for details.|
